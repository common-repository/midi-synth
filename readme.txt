== Description ==

MIDI-Synth is a synthesizer with a GM tone map. All timbres are generated by a combination of an oscillators and a dynamically generated BufferSource. Some synthesizer audio nodes have controls located on the front panel. The built-in oscilloscope displays the actual shape of the resulting synthesizer signal. The timbre Editor allows you to customize sound parameters. Changes in the tone editor take effect after pressing a music key. The Diagram shows the current configuration of the synthesizer's audio nodes.
